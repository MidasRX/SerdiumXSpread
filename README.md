   ```json
   {
       "api_keys": {
           "openai_api_key": "sk-...",
           "claude_api_key": "sk-ant-...",
           "gemini_api_key": "..."
       }
   }
   ```
   **Get API Keys:**
   - **OpenAI**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

   - **Gemini**: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Place your tokens in `Input/tokens.txt` (one per line) (optional)
3. Place your proxies in `Input/proxies.txt` (one per line, format: `ip:port`) (optional)

### MSAIADS - AI-Powered Ad Spammer

MSAIADS uses artificial intelligence to create natural, human-like ad messages. Here's how to use it:

1. **Get an AI API Key:**
   - Choose from OpenAI (ChatGPT), Anthropic (Claude), or Google (Gemini)
   - Get your API key from the respective provider's website:
     - **OpenAI**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
     - **Claude**: https://console.anthropic.com/
     - **Gemini**: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - Add it to `config.json` under `api_keys`:
     ```json
     {
         "api_keys": {
             "openai_api_key": "sk-...",
             "claude_api_key": "sk-ant-...",
             "gemini_api_key": "..."
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Select a Persona:**
   - **Friendly Gamer Friend**: Acts like a real friend trying to get friends to try a game. Uses casual language and gaming slang.
   - **Professional Ad Creator**: A professional marketer who explains what they're doing when asked. Answers questions clearly and professionally.

3. **Enter Your Message/Prompt:**
   - Tell the AI what you want to promote or mention
   - The AI will adapt this into natural, conversational messages
   - Example: "Try this amazing new game called GameName, it's really fun and we should play together!"

4. **Choose Target:**
   - **DMs only**: Send to all direct message channels
   - **Servers only**: Send to all channels in all servers
   - **Both**: Send to both DMs and servers

5. **How It Works:**
   - The AI generates unique, natural-sounding messages for each recipient
   - Each message is adapted from your base prompt but sounds authentic and personal
   - The selected persona maintains consistency in tone and style
   - Messages are generated on-the-fly, so each one may be slightly different while maintaining your core message

**Note:** The AI generates messages dynamically, making each message unique while staying true to your promotional content.

### Input Files

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Import Errors

**Problem:** `ImportError: cannot import name 'WebSocketApp' from 'websocket'`

**Solution:**
```bash
pip uninstall websocket -y
pip install websocket-client selenium
```

#### Module Not Found

**Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'X'`

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Permission Errors

**Problem:** Cannot create files or directories

**Solution:** Run with administrator privileges or check folder permissions

#### Rate Limiting

**Problem:** Getting rate limited by Discord/Telegram

**Solution:**
- Use slower speed settings
- Reduce the number of concurrent operations
- Add delays between requests
- Use proxies (if allowed by platform terms)

### Getting Help
